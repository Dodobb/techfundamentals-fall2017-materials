As a data scientist you will often need to search for information on various libraries and tools.  In this class we will be using several key python libraries.  Here are their documentation pages:

* **Python:**
  * [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/):  Teach yourself python.  This is a pretty comprehensive tutorial.
  * [Python + Numpy Tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) 

  * [Python 101](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas/raw/master/lessons/Python_101.ipynb): A notebook demonstrating a lot of python functionality with some (minimal explanation).


* **Plotting:**
  * [matplotlib.pyplot tutorial](http://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html#pyplot-tutorial): This short tutorial provides an overview of the basic plotting utilities we will be using.
  * [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html): The Seaborn library has some nice additional visualization functions that we may use occasionally.  

* **Pandas:**
  * [The Pandas Cookbook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jvns/pandas-cookbook/tree/master/cookbook/):  This provides a nice overview of some of the basic Pandas functions.  However, it is slightly out of date.
  * [Learn Pandas](https://bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas) A set of lessons providing an overview of the Pandas library.  
  * [Python for Data Science](http://wavedatalab.github.io/datawithpython/index.html) Another set of notebook demonstrating Pandas functionality.

* **Git:**
  * [Getting Started with Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control): A tutorial on version control and Git.
  * [Git Reference](http://gitref.org): A condense version of git instructions.
  * [Understanding the Git Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/): This will give you a better idea of how Git projects work.
  * [Learning about Branches](http://learngitbranching.js.org): This is a perhaps overly interactive tutorial that some people might find helpful.
  * [Explaining Git with D3](http://onlywei.github.io/explain-git-with-d3/)
